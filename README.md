# MemsFCR 
The Mems FCR supports Mac and Windows. The application connects using the serial interface and supports the serial FTDI cables you can purchase for the Android MemsDiag application. Instructions on how to create this cable or alternatively build a bluetooth wireless interface are also included.

All MEMS data points are read and can be viewed directly. If any faults have been detected these will be displayed and can be cleared.
